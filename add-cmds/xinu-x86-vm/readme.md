The Goal of this project is:

Create a new process with a user specified priority that starts running in an empty infinite loop after announcing its PID.

Create a new shell command called “createsleep”. The command creates a new process with a user specified priority that starts running in an empty infinite loop after announcing its PID after calling sleep or sleepms to sleep for 10 seconds.

Create a new shell command called “psready” to list the content of the ready list only. So, the difference between the “psready” and the “ps” is the “psready” is a new command that only prints the ready processes

Create a new shell command called “wait” to create a new process that starts waiting on a semaphore that you created with the initial count of zero after announcing its PID.

Create a new shell command called “signaln” to signal the given semaphore id using signaln.
